    <p>
      Dental conditions like decay do not usually cause pain until they are well advanced and impact the nerve protected deep inside your tooth. Anytime you experience pain in a tooth, it’s your body’s way of alerting you to a problem. Ignoring the problem will likely cause it to worsen and may even result in the need for an extraction.
