      <p>
        The following are the most typical reasons for dental surgery:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A tooth can no longer be restored or saved.</b></li>
        <li><b>The tooth is not functional or cannot be cleaned.</b></li>
        <li><b>The patient prefers to extract the tooth.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can remove or extract the problem tooth under local anaesthetic. This will also require a consultation/discussion before the extraction. An x-ray is taken to diagnose the issue. Teeth can be extracted on the same day if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        After your extraction, we can provide extra gauze, painkillers or antibiotics for any infection. This is to ensure your comfort and make healing as trouble-free as possible.

      <p>
        We can also provide extractions of straight-forward wisdom teeth cases under local anaesthetic. But for more difficult wisdom teeth, patients often prefer to see a specialist or be â€˜put to sleep' in a hospital. We can arrange that very easily for you.
