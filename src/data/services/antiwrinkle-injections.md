<p>
  Everyday expressions such as concentrating, smiling and squinting can cause fine lines to form on delicate facial tissue. With the modern use of devices and computers, the toll on the appearance of the skin can be even more dramatic
</p>
<p>
  Apart from being able to provide a beautiful smile of nice, white teeth, we can also ‘frame’ the teeth with beautiful lips and help to remove or decrease facial lines so you can maintain a youthful, healthy smile and expression.
</p>
<p>
  Fairfield Dental Care offer cosmetic dentistry services, but why stop there? Anti-wrinkle injections provide a youthful look to your skin to complement your new smile.

    - label: "How Anti-Wrinkle Injections Work"
      value: "
      <p>
        Underlying muscles move the skin on the face and provide facial fullness. Over time, wrinkles develop from habitual expressions. By relaxing facial muscles, the skin can then regain youthful smoothness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Injections introduce medication to the underlying muscles, causing subtle relaxation. By beginning with a smaller dose of medication, we provide natural results to combat common expression lines.

        <ul>
          <li><b>Marionette lines</b> – the parentheses around the mouth</li>
          <li><b>Bunny lines</b> – the lines along the sides of the nose</li>
          <li><b>Angry eleven</b> – the vertical lines between eyebrows</li>
          <li><b>Crows’ feet</b> – the horizontal lines along the corners of the eyes</li>
          <li><b>Prominent jaw</b> – a square or boxy jaw due to teeth grinding</li>
          <li><b>Gummy smiles</b> – tension in the upper lip exposes an excessive amount of gum when smiling</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      "

    - label: "TMJ, Headaches and Bruxism Therapy"
      value: "
      <p>
        Headaches or facial pain caused by temporomandibular disorders (TMD) or teeth grinding (or bruxism) can be treated by introducing medication to relax the powerful jaw muscles and reduce the amount of force you can exert subconsciously, which often occurs during sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Tension headaches</b> - relief from painful headaches</li>
          <li><b>Migraines</b> - a reduction of jaw strain provides relief from migraines</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    - label: "Why Choose a Dentist for Anti-Wrinkle Injections?"
      value: "
      <p>
        As part of their training and education, dentists develop an advanced knowledge of facial muscles. Often, choosing a dentist over an aesthetician will provide more desirable results with a focused treatment of the muscles causing wrinkles.
      </p>
      "

    - label: "Natural-Looking Results"
      value: "
      <p>
        As with our cosmetic dentistry procedures, the goal of anti-wrinkle injections is for subtle yet stunning results.
      </p>
      <p>
        You never have to worry about the 'frozen face' effect. Dr El-Khoury will first use small amounts of anti-wrinkle medication to determine your body’s unique reaction and then make adjustments at subsequent visits for excellent results.
      </p>
      "

    - label: "A Temporary, Non-Surgical Solution"
      value: "
      <p>
        Surgical procedures are costly and complex. The temporary results of anti-wrinkle injectables keep treatment reversible and adjustable. Each round of injectables typically lasts for about 3 to 4 months. You can choose to maintain your youthful appearance by repeating the procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anti-wrinkle injections are well-tolerated and cause only mild discomfort. Some bruising is possible, but it is temporary and a rare side effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will have no downtime. You can even come in for your treatment on your lunch break and return to work the same day. Some common sense caution will improve results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid massaging the area</li>
          <li>Avoid lying down for several hours after injections</li>
          <li>Avoid strenuous exercise for the remainder of the day</li>
          <li>Use gentle cleansers and moisturisers</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anti-wrinkle injections work best for mild to moderate wrinkles. A consultation will determine if you will achieve your desired results using this non-invasive treatment option.
