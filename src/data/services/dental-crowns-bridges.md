  If you have been putting off dental treatment because you are worried about the impact it will have on your smile, you'll be happy to know that Fairfield Dental Care provide a way to keep the natural look of your teeth with modern dental crowns and bridges.
</p>
<p>
  Dentistry no longer requires metal components that have a negative aesthetic impact or cause you to hide your smile due to dark margins or wires.

      value: "
      <p>
        Deep decay, fractures and wear all compromise the function and comfort of teeth. A dental crown, or cap, completely encases your natural tooth and reinforces it with durable porcelain or ceramic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dental crowns often take the place of large fillings on molars, which absorb much of the force from chewing because they add strength in addition to sealing the tooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using The Wand painless injection device, Dr James El-Khoury will remove decay and reshape the tooth to create enough space for your crown. He will then take an impression to give our local dental lab the information they need to create your custom crown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dental crowns come in several materials, and Dr El-Khoury will go over the benefits and limitations of each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Porcelain or ceramic – the most natural, tooth-coloured option
      </p>
      <p>
        Porcelain and metal blends – for added strength with a mostly natural appearance
      </p>
      <p>
        Full gold – for patients who have a heavy bite and want a durable option 
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr El-Khoury will place a temporary restoration over the tooth to protect it until your final restoration is ready. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At a follow-up appointment, Dr El-Khoury will remove the temporary and place your final crown over your tooth with permanent cement. He will make any small adjustments needed to ensure a proper fit and comfortable function.
      </p>

    - label: "Dental Bridges Replace Missing Teeth"
      value: "
      <p>
        Dental bridges require crowns on two healthy adjacent teeth to hold an artificial tooth in place. In most cases, patients opt for porcelain or ceramic bridges to complement their smiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dental bridge process is similar to that of a crown, requiring preparation of the tooth and an appointment to place your bridge. For multiple teeth missing in a row, <b>dental implant-supported bridges can add the stability necessary for proper chewing function without the need for a partial denture.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dental bridges require some special care to protect them and keep the underlying gums healthy. Small brushes and special floss make it easy to remove food that can collect on and around your bridge. We will demonstrate ways to get the most out of your dentistry.
