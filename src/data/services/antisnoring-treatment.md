It’s hard enough these days to make sure you get enough sleep for optimum health without battling a snoring habit that can disturb healthy sleep patterns. When snoring occurs, it can interrupt restorative sleep and keep everyone in the house awake. Loud snoring may also cause partners to seek refuge in another room, which can affect intimacy in a relationship.
</p>
<p>
Quality sleep is essential to the efficient function of every system within the body. Inadequate restorative sleep can cause mood disorders, weight gain and heart disease as well as complicate diabetes.
</p>
<p>
At Fairfield Dental Care, we offer a convenient solution to quiet snoring.

      value: "
      <p>
        Snoring occurs when the muscles at the back of the throat begin to relax and allow the tissue or tongue to narrow the airway toward the back of the throat. Narrow airways create vibrations when patients inhale and exhale during sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Certain factors increase snoring:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Excess weight or obesity</li>
        <li>Alcohol or drug use</li>
        <li>Certain medications</li>
        <li>Sinus infections and colds</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
        <li>Enlarged adenoids (tonsils)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While snoring is more common in men, anyone can snore, including children. Waking up with a sore throat is an indication of snoring, but you may not know you snore unless a family member or partner tells you.

    - label: "How Oral Appliance Therapy for Snoring Works"
      value: "
      <p>
        Oral appliances for snoring and other types of sleep-disordered breathing use a comfortable custom nightguard to gently guide the lower (mandibular) jaw forward, removing tissue from the back of the throat where snoring vibrations occur.
      </p>
