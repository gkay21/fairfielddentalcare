<p>
  A root canal is a dental procedure designed to treat and save a severely damaged or infected tooth. Within each tooth, beneath the enamel and dentin layers, lies a soft tissue known as the pulp. The pulp contains nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue, playing a vital role during the tooth's development.
</p>
<p>
  When the pulp becomes infected due to deep decay, a cracked tooth, or repeated dental procedures, it can lead to severe pain and potential complications if left untreated. A root canal intervention becomes necessary to alleviate pain, prevent the spread of infection, and preserve the natural tooth.

        Root canals relieve the severe symptoms patients experience when they develop an infection near the nerve of a tooth. While diagnosing the need for a root canal requires an exam in our Fairfield dental clinic, some symptoms indicate that calling our practice for an examination is a wise decision:
        <ul>
          <li>Pain, swelling and pressure</li>
          <li>Sensitivity to hot foods and drinks</li>
          <li>Tooth discolouration</li>
          <li>A small lesion on the gums</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Many patients are concerned that root canal therapy will hurt, but treatment actually heals and alleviates symptoms.

        We use The Wand for painless injections to ensure that you feel comfortable throughout your procedure.

        After making a small access to the interior of the tooth, Dr El-Khoury will clean out the infection and bacteria inside the canal and apply medication to assist with healing. He will fill the canal and seal the tooth to protect it during the healing process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Removing the nerve fibre and blood supply inside the tooth can cause it to become brittle. In many cases, we will recommend a crown to protect and stabilise the tooth, especially posterior (back) teeth that are exposed to force when chewing.

        Saving your natural teeth is often the simplest and most affordable way to protect your smile and your dental health. Dr El-Khoury will discuss all of your treatment options along with their benefits so that you can make an informed choice.
