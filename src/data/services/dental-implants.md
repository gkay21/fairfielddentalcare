  At Fairfield Dental Care, we develop lasting relationships with our patients and care deeply for their wellbeing. When patients require an extraction or lose a tooth to disease or an accident, we realise that this is an emotional time that causes you to question how you will speak and smile with confidence.

<p>
  Our team is here to help.

    - label: "Benefits of Dental Implants"
      value: "
    <p>
      Patients often choose dental implants to replace missing teeth because they are the most natural and long-lasting way to restore teeth and protect your oral health and appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Natural-looking results</b> – Dental implants look and feel similar to natural teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bone retention</b> – Dental implants replace the entire tooth, including the root, which maintains underlying bone and facial fullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Healthy bite</b> – Dental implants fill the gap in the smile and keep adjacent teeth from shifting, which keeps teeth aligned properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>No dietary restrictions</b> – You can eat all of your favourite foods with dental implants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Denture retention</b> – If you want dentures but wish to avoid movement, dental implants can lock your denture in place.
    </p>

    - label: "Dental Implant Planning"
      value: "
    <p>
      Dentistry is a combination of science and aesthetics. Precise planning will ensure excellent results that give you a healthy smile for many years – even a lifetime. Dr El-Khoury will perform a comprehensive dental evaluation to verify that adequate bone quality exists to support the dental implant. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bone loss does not mean that you are exempt from dental implant treatment. Bone grafting and sinus lifts can make it possible for almost anyone to qualify for implants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital x-rays and moulds of teeth will assist Dr El-Khoury with identifying the ideal location for the dental implant.
    </p>
    "

    - label: "Dental Implant Surgery"
      value: "
    <p>
      Dental implants are made of titanium, a biocompatible material that will fuse with natural bone. Dental implant surgery causes minimal discomfort, and patients report only mild symptoms in the days following treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, we can place bone grafting material or dental implants on the same day as your extraction, simplifying your treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your dental implant is in place, we allow time for healing and integration, which typically takes about 3 to 4 months.
    </p>

    - label: "Dental Implant Crown Placement"
      value: "
    <p>
      The dental crown is the part of the dental implant that replaces your tooth. It attaches to the dental implant with a small abutment. Dr El-Khoury designs dental crowns to complement your smile with natural shading and colour to blend in and encourage you to show off your teeth with a big smile.
