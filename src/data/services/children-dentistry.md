      <p>
        The impression we make now may have an emotional impact on how kids view dental visits in the future. A positive outlook can make seeking necessary dental care a welcome, rather than stressful, experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing positive habits requires a team that genuinely cares for children and knows how to engage their attention. We have two oral therapists who love working with children and educating them about caring for their smiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Speak in child-friendly language</li>
          <li>Teach rather than tell</li>
          <li>Involve children in their oral health</li>
          <li>Avoid scary words</li>
          <li>Provide gentle care</li>
          <li>Work at the child’s pace</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's your child’s first visit or they are already developing their permanent teeth, we want you to feel confident in the care your little ones receive. Parents are welcome to participate in dental visits or to relax in our welcome area while we work with your child.

    - label: "Paediatric Preventive Dentistry"
      value: "
      <p>
        Our approach to preventive paediatric care ensures that every patient receives the dentistry they require at every life stage. Prevention is especially important as their primary (deciduous or baby) teeth provide the blueprint for their future smiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dental exam</li>
          <li>Clean and polish</li>
          <li>Fluoride application</li>
          <li>Fissure sealants</li>
          <li>Sports mouthguards</li>
          <li>Digital radiographs (x-rays)</li>

          <li>Oral hygiene instruction</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      We will discuss your child’s individual needs and base recommendations for treatment on their oral health, dietary habits and personal risk for common oral diseases, such as decay. We always present treatment options along with their benefits and respect the choice that parents make for their children.
      "

    - label: "Caring for Growing Smiles"
      value: "
      <p>
        As your child grows, they may require additional dentistry, such as fillings, space maintainers or recommendations for interceptive orthodontics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early diagnosis, made possible with high-resolution digital x-rays, often reduces the cost and complexity of future treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decay is one of the most common preventable childhood diseases. Improvements in oral care products and knowledge regarding how decay develops make it possible to prevent decay. Most children, however, will need at least one filling throughout their lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr El-Khoury proudly offers tooth-coloured fillings to reduce the visibility and social stigma created by metal-based fillings. To ensure your child’s comfort, we use The Wand anaesthetic delivery, which delivers the local anaesthetic slowly, carefully and painlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After removing decay from the tooth, Dr El-Khoury will match the tooth colour to the composite material, fill the cavity and cure it using light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every child is unique. Our comprehensive approach to paediatric dentistry, along with a partnership with parents, will support a healthy, comfortable smile.
