        Veneers are thin shells that look like the front of a tooth. They have realistic shading for a natural look. Dr El-Khoury can discuss the types of veneers and determine whether they will help you gain the smile you have always wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Composite veneers</b> – Composite veneers are made of the same material we use in tooth-coloured fillings, and we can create them in our Fairfield dental clinic. Since they offer a more opaque result, they are perfect for covering a single discoloured tooth that will not respond to professional teeth whitening.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Porcelain veneers</b> – Porcelain or ceramic veneers are more translucent and look just like a natural tooth. They require fabrication at our local dental lab. When covering multiple teeth, or your whole smile, porcelain veneers provide the most realistic outcomes.

        Years of damage, neglect or wear can leave front teeth looking broken down.

        When looking to improve your appearance, achieving your ideal smile in fewer procedures is likely appealing. Veneers offer a solution to many cosmetic concerns using one innovative procedure that corrects many aesthetic concerns at once.

        Since dental veneers cover the front of your natural teeth, usually those visible when you smile, we will want to make sure that your smile looks seamless and natural. You might want to begin by having your teeth professionally whitened for overall brighter results. We offer both in-house and take-home whitening options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr El-Khoury will evaluate your oral health before we get started. Placing dental restorations in a mouth that is free of gum disease and decay is ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will then take a mould of teeth to create models that Dr El-Khoury uses to design your new smile. Veneers need to come together properly to keep your chewing function comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and Dr El-Khoury will discuss smiles you admire and go over the exciting details like colour and shading. We want you to feel delighted with your results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Veneers require some prep work to make sure that your smile never looks bulky or false. Once Dr El-Khoury polishes the surfaces of the teeth, he will take an impression to send to our lab to design your new smile. Temporaries will cover your teeth until we receive your permanent veneers – usually in a week or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        He will then bond your permanent veneers to your teeth. You will leave our Fairfield dental clinic with a beautiful smile that makes you feel great about the way you look.
