      <p>
        Professional teeth whitening is one of the most affordable and easiest ways to give your smile a boost. At Fairfield Dental Care, we offer both in-chair and take-home whitening options.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In-chair teeth whitening</b> provides patients with fast results, which is particularly convenient if you have an upcoming special event, such as a reunion, holiday or anniversary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Our custom take-home whitening system</b> includes custom trays to keep the gel in place for the brightest results.

       Today's dental restorations enhance teeth, rather than leave a dark mark. Fairfield dentist Dr James El-Khoury combines the art of custom dental restorations with the dental science that ensures proper function and a comfortable bite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bonded fillings, crowns and veneers all have the capability of improving the shape and colour of teeth. After a consultation to discuss your goals for your smile, Dr El-Khoury will organise a treatment plan to help you achieve a youthful, stunning look.

    - label: "Anti-Wrinkle Injectables"
      value: "
      <p>
        As part of a comprehensive cosmetic approach, Dr El-Khoury also offers anti-wrinkle injectables to smooth lines caused by our modern lifestyles. Stress, computer use and smart phones produce habitual expressions (like squinting and concentrating) that leave deep grooves in the skin that may make you appear aged or tired. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anti-wrinkle injections relax the underlying muscles to smooth the skin. <b>You never have to worry about a frozen-face look, either.</b> Dr El-Khoury’s knowledge of facial muscles and anatomy means conservative treatment with outstanding results.

      value: "
      <p>          
        Many people only dream of a perfect smile. With porcelain veneers, that uniform, movie star look can be a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Porcelain veneers are ultra-thin, tooth-like restorations that cover your existing tooth to improve length, shape and colour. Veneers even close gaps and give the appearance of straight teeth without braces.
      <p>    
        Veneers require proper planning to ensure successful results. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr El-Khoury plans treatment meticulously and works closely with our patients to give them their dream smiles.

          <li>Final dental restorations</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Patients may opt to improve a single tooth or all of their visible teeth. The purpose is for the results to look completely natural to the eye. Your smile must also feel comfortable when you chew and speak. Dr El-Khoury’s professional experience gives patients the best of both worlds.
