CDBS or Child Dental Benefits Scheme is a scheme that covers dental work up to $1000.00 over a 2 calendar year period. The CDBS provides individual benefits for a range of services including examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing, fillings, root canals, and extractions.

Dental work can either be claimed directly from your dentist, or submitted to Medicare. Each dental practice is different. Here at our practice, we have chosen to claim the treatment directly from Medicare for you. This saves you time and energy. All you need to do is to keep a track of your child's balance, which is simple as we will issue you with a receipt for each procedure.

###### Eligibility basics

- Children between 2 to 17 years old
- They’re enrolled in Medicare
- You get certain payments\* for at least part of the calendar year

_\*The CDBS has a means test, which requires receipt of Family Tax Benefit Part A or a relevant Australian Government payment._

> If you are unsure whether your child is eligible, please give us a call on 9724 1163, we would be more than happy to check your medicare number on our system.

Alice and Belinda are our Dental Hygienist/Therapists that specialise in treating our younger patients. They have time set aside especially for CDBS kids, so rest assured that we will do our best to schedule your childs appointment asap and at a time convenient to you!

**Please don’t let this opportunity slip by, book your child in today!**
