Although a muscle relaxant injection was originally used for medical purposes, perhaps the most commonly known use today is in facial aesthetic treatment. Facial Injectables are becoming increasingly popular.

Lines caused by the action of the muscles of your facial expression can artificially age a person and have a significant impact on self-esteem. Injections relax the action of the underlying muscles and minimise the resulting lines.

Traditionally, lines appearing on the forehead, between the eyes, and around the eyes (crow’s feet), have been the most common areas treated, however the number of new uses for this remarkable substance has expanded substantially and includes other areas of direct importance to Dentists These include the treatment of TMJ disorders, tooth grinding, “gummy smiles” and much more.

Owing to superior knowledge of facial anatomy, daily practical experience dealing with the functional and aesthetic aspects of muscles of the face and an ability to provide accurate and comfortable injections, Dentists are the most qualified people to be providing facial muscle relaxant injections.

The hyperactive lip muscle can be relaxed during smiling, reducing the excessive lip elevation and eliminating the “Gummy Smile”.

As well as botox, dermal fillers are something that can also make a huge difference to your smile!

As we age, the skin loses elasticity, volume and structural support which leads to the formation of deep lines, grooves and folds – especially around the mouth. In addition to this, our lips, which are perhaps the most prominent aesthetic feature of our face, begin to lose volume and become thinner and less well defined. Lines are formed by skin folds commonly running between the nose, mouth and chin. These furrows are among the first to appear on the aging face. These, together with lip enhancements are the primary areas treated by Dermal Fillers to improve facial aesthetics.

Dermal Fillers are a temporary treatment method that provides immediate results for eliminating these facial lines. They consist of a substance that naturally occurs in our bodies and is therefore broken down by natural means and is hypo-allergenic.

Realising that the result of aesthetic dentistry are limited by the condition of the facial tissues surrounding the mouth means that Dermal Filler treatment is the logical next step for Dentists wishing to frame their ‘artistry’.

Dermal Fillers can be used to correct some spaces between teeth, easily and safely. Until now, this has been a difficult problem to correct.
