When you find out that you are pregnant, there are so many things that you need to think of; getting the nursery ready, clothes, nappies, wipes, toys etc… It is understandable that the last thing you would think of is how this pregnancy will affect your teeth!

There is an old wives tale that suggests that a mother loses one tooth for every baby that she has. While your oral health is definitely something you should keep on top of while you are pregnant (and beyond), there is no need to lose teeth whilst pregnant!

As we all know, hormones change throughout the 9 months during pregnancy. These hormone changes make women more susceptible to oral health problems. But, it is also worth noting that not having your oral health in check when you become pregnant can also put you at higher risk of having your baby prematurely. Studies show that approx. 18 in 100 cases of premature birth are linked to gum disease.

Growing a human can be hungry work and sweet cravings may increase your risk of tooth decay. This is more than enough reason to keep up your regular visits to the dentist.

Many women can experience morning sickness when pregnant. The acids in vomit can temporarily weaken the enamel that protects your teeth. So, while we say to brush, brush, brush…make sure you wait at least 30 minutes before brushing your teeth so as not to damage that precious enamel. Understandably, women want to freshen up after a little ‘episode’, so why not try rinsing with a fluoride mouthwash instead.

There is always ways to protect yourself against these oral health problems. If you are planning a pregnancy, make sure you plan a visit to your dentist to ensure you are giving your teeth and gums the best possible start. Together we can lower your risks of gum disease, tooth decay and erosion.
