### Here are some dental myths that we have busted!

###### Do Oral Diseases only affect your mouth?

No. There is actually strong evidence linking oral diseases to the rest of your body. Gum disease can increase the risk of many chronic diseases (and vice-versa) such as heart disease, diabetes and osteoporosis.

###### Is Fluoride in toothpaste dangerous?

No. Fluoride is added to your everyday toothpaste in safe doses. Many studies have proven that fluoride is effective in helping protect your teeth from decay. It should be noted that it is not recommended that you swallow toothpaste. Children should always use a toothpaste formulated especially for children as they contain less fluoride.

###### Is fruit juice a good alternative to water for children?

Only in moderation. It is true that soft drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks are some of the leading causes of tooth decay. But, fruit juices can contain the same amounts of sugar and acids.

###### Should you rinse your mouth after brushing?

No. It is said that up to 66% of Australians rinse after brushing. The benefit of not rinsing after brushing is that the fluoride from your toothpaste has a longer time to absorb into your teeth.
