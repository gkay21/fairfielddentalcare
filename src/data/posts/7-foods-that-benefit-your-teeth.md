We all know about the foods that are bad for our teeth, but what foods actually benefit your teeth?

**Cheese** – Eating cheese raises the pH in your mouth, this lowers your risk of decay. It is thought that the chewing action required when eating cheese increases saliva. Cheese also contains calcium and protein, nutrients proven to strengthen tooth enamel.

**Yoghurt** – Apart from containing calcium and protein like cheese, yoghurt has probiotics that benefit your gums. The good bacteria take over the bad bacteria that cause cavities. Just make sure your yoghurt has minimal sugar…you don’t want to undo all the good work!

**Apples** – The fibrous texture of apples stimulates your gums and the action of eating an apple produces saliva. Saliva washes away bacteria and also some food particles between your teeth. Although eating an apple is NOT an alternative to brushing your teeth with a toothbrush and paste, it is a great idea to finish a meal with an apple or apple slices to give your mouth that nice clean feeling.

**Carrots** – Like apples, carrots are full of fibre. Eating a raw carrot produces saliva and can help clean your mouth after a meal too. They are also very high in vitamin A.

**Celery** – This vegetable acts a bit like a toothbrush too. It is high in water and helps scrap food and bacteria off your teeth. Celery is a great source of vitamins A and C, two antioxidants that give the health of your gums a boost!

**Leafy Greens** – Obviously green is good but did you know that leafy greens are high in calcium, which is good for your tooth enamel. If you’re pregnant you will also benefit from the folic acid, which is said to possibly treat gum disease in pregnant ladies amongst other health benefits.

**Almonds** – While being low in sugar, almonds are a good source of calcium and protein. A handful of almonds make a great snack!

One of the first areas to decline when your diet is less than ideal is your oral health…you are what you eat!
